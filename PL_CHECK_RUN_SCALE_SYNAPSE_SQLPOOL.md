This JSON code defines an Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline named "PL_CHECK_RUN_SCALE_SYNAPSE_SQLPOOL" that checks and scales dedicated SQL pools within an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. 
Here's a breakdown of the code:

Pipeline Name and Description:

Name: PL_CHECK_RUN_SCALE_SYNAPSE_SQLPOOL
Description: Pipeline used to check and scale dedicated SQL pools up or down.
Pipeline Properties:

Description: Additional information about the pipeline's purpose.
Activities: An array of activities that the pipeline will execute.
Activities:

Get list of dedicated SQL pools:

Type: WebActivity - Retrieves a list of dedicated SQL pools in the Synapse Analytics workspace.
URL: Constructs the URL using pipeline parameters to target the SQL pools.
Method: GET - Fetches information.
Authentication: Uses Managed Service Identity (MSI) for authentication.
Filter sql pools:

Type: Filter - Filters out SQL pools that do not match a specified condition.
Depends On: Depends on the success of the "Get list of dedicated SQL pools" activity.
Condition: Excludes SQL pools with names ending with 'prod'.
ForEach pool:

Type: ForEach - Iterates over the filtered list of SQL pools.
Depends On: Depends on the success of the "Filter sql pools" activity.
Activities:
GetState:

Type: WebActivity - Retrieves the current state of each SQL pool in the iteration.
URL: Constructs the URL using pipeline parameters to target a specific SQL pool.
Method: GET - Fetches information.
Authentication: Uses Managed Service Identity (MSI) for authentication.
Check-If-Matching:

Type: IfCondition - Checks if the current state matches the desired performance level.
Depends On: Depends on the success of the "GetState" activity.
Expression: Evaluates if the current performance level matches the desired level.
IfFalseActivities: If not matching, executes another pipeline ("PL_SCALE_SYNAPSE_SQLPOOL") to scale the SQL pool.
Parameters:

Defines input parameters that can be configured when the pipeline is invoked.
ResourceGroup, SubscriptionID, WorkspaceName, and PerformanceLevel are parameters.
Folder and Annotations:

Specifies the folder location in the Azure Data Factory where the pipeline is stored.
Annotations are not provided in this pipeline.
In summary, the pipeline fetches a list of dedicated SQL pools, filters out those with names ending in 'prod', and then iterates over the remaining pools. For each pool, it checks if the current performance level matches the desired level. If not, it triggers another pipeline ("PL_SCALE_SYNAPSE_SQLPOOL") to scale the SQL pool to the desired performance level.
