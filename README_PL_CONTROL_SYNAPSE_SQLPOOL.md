This JSON code defines an Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline named "PL_CONTROL_SYNAPSE_SQLPOOL" that manages the state (pause or resume) of dedicated SQL pools within an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. Below is a breakdown of the code:

Pipeline Name and Description:

Name: PL_CONTROL_SYNAPSE_SQLPOOL
Description: Pipeline used to control (pause or resume) dedicated SQL pools.
Pipeline Properties:

Activities: An array of activities that the pipeline will execute.
Activities:

Get list of dedicated SQL pools:

Type: WebActivity - Retrieves a list of dedicated SQL pools in the Synapse Analytics workspace.
URL: Constructs the URL using pipeline parameters to target the SQL pools.
Method: GET - Fetches information.
Authentication: Uses Managed Service Identity (MSI) for authentication.
Filter sql pools:

Type: Filter - Filters out SQL pools that do not match a specified condition.
Depends On: Depends on the success of the "Get list of dedicated SQL pools" activity.
Condition: Excludes SQL pools with names ending with 'prod'.
ForEach pool:

Type: ForEach - Iterates over the filtered list of SQL pools.
Depends On: Depends on the success of the "Filter sql pools" activity.
Activities:
CheckState:

Type: WebActivity - Retrieves the current state of each SQL pool in the iteration.
URL: Constructs the URL using pipeline parameters to target a specific SQL pool.
Method: GET - Fetches information.
Authentication: Uses Managed Service Identity (MSI) for authentication.
State-PauseOrResume:

Type: Switch - Switches between different cases based on the current state and the desired action (pause or resume).
Depends On: Depends on the success of the "CheckState" activity.
Cases: Two cases are defined based on the concatenation of the current state and the desired action.
If the case is "Paused-resume," it executes a "SQLPoolResume" WebActivity to resume the SQL pool.
If the case is "Online-pause," it executes a "SQLPoolPause" WebActivity to pause the SQL pool.
Parameters:

Defines input parameters that can be configured when the pipeline is invoked.
ResourceGroup, SubscriptionID, WorkspaceName, SQLPoolName, and PauseOrResume are parameters.
Folder and Annotations:

Specifies the folder location in the Azure Data Factory where the pipeline is stored.
Annotations are not provided in this pipeline.
In summary, the pipeline fetches a list of dedicated SQL pools, filters out those with names ending in 'prod', and then iterates over the remaining pools. For each pool, it checks the current state and performs a specific action (pause or resume) based on the defined conditions.
